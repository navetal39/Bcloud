*Befor a comment in the same line you comment on put a space and start the comment after another space. [Worded in stammering, will be repaired when I have the power]. For example:
l = list() # creat a new list.
*Lines that are 'for the record' will be marked with a comment like so: # -For The Record-
*It's best to put a space before and after a sign as these '='/'=='/'!='/'>'/etc.


Keep that and the code will look good! :)
